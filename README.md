# Molecular Classification of Leukemia

This project focuses on classifying leukemia types using gene expression data to improve diagnosis accuracy.

## Objectives
- Analyze gene expression profiles.
- Classify leukemia subtypes (AML, ALL).
- Apply machine learning for prediction.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Datasets: Leukemia Microarray or RNA-seq data

## Results
Models identify genetic patterns that help distinguish leukemia subtypes and support better medical understanding.
